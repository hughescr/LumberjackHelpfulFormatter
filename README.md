Lumberjack Helpful Formatter
============================

This is a formatter for https://github.com/CocoaLumberjack/CocoaLumberjack which is designed to have a relatively nice, parsable log format that includes most of what you will want to record.  In particular, when used in conjunction with https://github.com/hughescr/LumberjackLE you can log things to LogEntries and write a nice formatter on LogEntries to automatically identify warnings, errors, etc.
